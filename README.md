## About
A website which demonstrates how different sorting algorithms function. Currently implemented: merge sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, and quick sort.

The code is split into two folders: SortingVisualiser & SortingAlgorithms.
SortingAlgorithms contains a file for each sorting algorithm which has been altered to return an array of values which SortingVisualiser can use to manipulate the DOM and display the sequence for that particular algorithm.
